## A jumble of things

A classification system is indeed a practical skill. The process of learning and applying the knowledge and experience we acquire. It revolves around how we categorize the information we receive and how we retrieve it when needed (Going a step further, memory techniques are also crucial and actually related to classification. Effective memory methods and classification strategies, when manifested in practical situations, can be seen as signs of intelligence.). From another perspective, how a person categorizes the information they acquire and the number of classification methods they employ also indicates the depth and breadth of their knowledge accumulation.

Let's take a more practical case: installing MongoDB on Ubuntu using Docker. From a procedural view, this falls within the realm of DevOps or operations. If we look at it conceptually, this task involves the Linux operating system, the utilization of shell, the utilization of Docker containers, and MongoDB usage. Going even further, it encompasses aspects such as networking, security, and so on.

During the student years, courses are organized according to the latter approach, categorizing subjects separately. This method allows for the maximum exploration and cross-application of knowledge, but it also has obvious disadvantages. It is more time-consuming and often involves a lot of irrelevant tasks. On the other hand, most work-related problems follow the former approach, directly seeking solutions that are targeted and efficient. However, this method has limitations as it lacks horizontal comparisons, making it easy to fall into pitfalls.

Blog posts and tags are manifestations of these two methods. Therefore, tags are still important. Most of the time, when searching for the same knowledge, it is not about the specific problem that was addressed in the original post, but rather a horizontal keyword search.
